I used to love this when I first started using it many years ago. Over time it started having lot of issues around reminders so I stopped using it. Now, I decided to give it a try again after 2-3 years and nothing works. I tried adding new medications and there was no input box to type the name of the medication. I tried adding reminder and was not able to do it. Basically the whole app has gone from excellent to piece of trash over last 7-8 years.

However, the latest update introduced a ridiculously strict limit of only 2 medications in the free version. Paying for basic functionality that’s already available in the default phone app (like ""Medications"") doesn’t make sense to me.

I need to track my blood glucose levels and now new meds and a variety of doctors appointments and tracking my Vitals. The reminders to take pills and customizable notes are quite literally a life save. I can track my doctors and appointments as well as send reports of sugar levels and other Vitals along with pill adherence. This app also tracks my med levels and sends reminders at a customizable time point to refill them. Best of all, the things I've needed it for are all free.

12910822816,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,1,Awesome except…,"When I use this app on my android phone, I never had one single problem with it. Ever since I started using it on my iPad, every time I have to confirm that I have taken/declined a med, I have to confirm twice. So when I tap on it to say “taken” or “not taken”, it never, and I mean, never, put a little checkmark or a little X next to the medication, it just refreshes without any annotation at all, as if I did nothing. Then I have to do it again in order for it to register. Otherwise this app is incredible! I have used it for years. I don’t really want to put one star but I’m sure that’s the only way to get the attention of the developers. I will change it when someone contacts me. Thank you.",PrncsLeiah,19.07.2025,us,9.48.0,0

Nearly ready to drop this if I can ‘t turn off the junk. It started as a wonderful app to provide medication reminders on a schedule. But then they thought it would be better if they added some other stuff. The problem is, as a responsible medicator, I already have those other aspects covered, taken care of and don’t require redundancy. But it’s right there. Didn’t ask me if I wanted it and don’t provide any way to turn it off. So suddenly, every morning, I am faced with bunches of trash all over my screen. I am ready to kick it out… actually, I did. I dumped it from my phone in a moment of “machine will NOT take over” The iPad  is on the verge of being booted. I’m sure I’m on a list of “don’t listen to him” because ALL  I really want is a list of my meds, with notices at the times I have to take them!

But when I attempted to keep track of my “as needed” Tylenol doses? Whoo boy. All sorts of fun ensued. It kept reminding me to take a dose and apparently the only way to stop it was deleting Tylenol from my list of medications and then re entering it again to my list.

No thanks.

When setting up the meds, it turns out that 3x a day is NOT the same as ""every 8 hours""—even though this is how hospitals do it. So it crams 3 doses into less time than intended, which is potentially dangerous. 

Next, the pill reminder is borderline unusable. There are 3 different views of your medications and schedule, and they each contain different information. The primary view doesn't even show my next dosing time. Why?

And if you take a dose late or early, it DOESN'T take that into account in your next dose (!!!!). So users, especially those who may have cognitive decline, can easily double up on dangerous meds like painkillers.

However, the developers are trying to add some health topics and information to the app. I keep getting these annoying pops asking which health topics I’m interested in. I am not at all interested in health topics from this app. I need this app to be a medicine reminder app, nothing more, nothing less. It was perfect as it was.

12114508219,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,1,Was nearly perfect until aggressive popup ads broke it,"I’m a long time user of Medisafe, it has been an essential app for reliably tracking a lot of meds for chronic illness. A few days ago the app started an aggressive marketing campaign of full screen pop-ups that have broken the app. I can’t even mark a med as taken without the pop-up freezing in the middle of it. Because of this confusion and trying to get the app started again and again, then getting rid of the pop-up, we’ve actually missed marking some essential meds and not knowing if they were taken or not. I am happy to support and to purchase Medisafe, but this feels like maybe the company has been sold and we’re not dealing with the same people, feels sketchy and it might be time to look for an alternative. It’s a shame because this was really an excellent app. We fully rely on it being dependable as we juggle a heavy medicine routine and I haven’t found another app that worked as well.

Previous review: I’ve been using Medisafe for a few years but not yet to its full potential. In the next few months I intend to do just that and will update my review once I have a clearer understanding of its capabilities.

One burning question: I recently opened the app and it requested a donation. Isn’t Medisafe a 2-tier application with a premium (paid) version alongside a free version?

Then why the request for the donation?  To be fair, I can think of several answers to my own question but they would be speculative, at best. I’d love to read a response from the developers. And I’m sure I’m not the only one to receive the request.

12112065522,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,1,Complaint on  Update for Premium Access Option Pop-up Message Box,"For two days, since the “Premium Access” update message box started popping up on my phone, my Medisafe app hasn’t run properly.  Whenever it’s time to take my meds the alert goes off, I open the app, and immediately the “Premium” upgrade offer pop-up is there.  When I decline the upgrade offer the upgrade box goes away, but then a little icon (I call a flower-clock) goes round and round, and I’m not able to access my medication.  If I close it out and reopen the app it starts over again with the “Premium upgrade” offer, then the rotating icon (flower).

Do not tell me to remove the app and re-download it, because if I have to reload all my meds again then I will download a different app altogether.  This issue has caused my opinion of the app to drop from a 5-star to a 1-star rating.

Major  suggestion besides fixing the above glitch…   provide an option to “permanently decline” account upgrade to “Premium.“ And then don’t allow  the upgrade option message pop-up box appear on that users account anymore.  Have the option for upgrade in their account management settings instead. Or create an upgrade option button icon at the bottom of the screen, below the meds list.",Cs Land,27.12.2024,us,9.44.2,0

Right now the only kid sounds are Finding Dory and Starwars. I think an option to import your own sounds and create your own alarms would make it more interesting and fun for all ages. Either that or add more kid sounds like kids shows and movies like Disney movies and stuff. I just think adding more sounds will make this app more fun and useful for kids and teens, like myself.

If you can’t find it there, there’s a spot to contact support directly, and it uses whatever mail program you have installed. I’m more used to having to look for support links in the App Store. Giving 1 more star for the reply from devs below. I’ll add another if they can get this issue fixed for me and hopefully it won’t happen to others.
~~~~~~
Update 1: I was hoping that with deleting the app and re-downloading it, all my data would have saved, since I have an active account. But clearly something failed in the transmission. Did you have a server crash in there somewhere? Anyway, *all* my medication history has been wiped out. There is nothing prior to today’s date. And all the new meds I had added in the last week and change? They’re gone too. At least I don’t have to re-enter all my regular meds. Their history may be gone, but I can continue tracking them from this morning onward. Again- I am not going to re-download the Mail app, which I deleted long ago, to be able to submit a ticket. If Outlook doesn’t work, then I guess I won’t submit a ticket. I just hope this issue doesn’t happen to anyone else. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Original review: I can’t open a support ticket without re-downloading and using the Mail app on my iOS device, so unfortunately for me this is the only way to let support know the app currently has a crash bug. Since the last update, sometimes I can get in to track my medications, and sometimes I can’t because the app just crashes. It will crash repeatedly, no matter how I try to open it (from a notification, from a single tap on the icon, or from holding my finger on the icon & selecting “add a diary entry”). I have done everything short of delete the app and reinstall it, but it’s getting so hard to use right now that this is what I’m going to have to do.

My husband will mark something taken, I’ll get reminders on my device, and log in and see they’re already marked. There’s a disconnect between taken status and notifications when using multiple devices/users, but we share caretaking responsibilities. - Allow more notification customizations - I keep getting notifications to add appointments or doctors, but we don’t use the app for that. Even with premium, I’d like to opt out of some types of notifications, or set it for med reminders only. - setting up multiple users/caretakers was not intuitive- it took us a few tries.

This app not only reminds me to take them, but sometimes it makes me laugh at the “voices.”  People who have been nearby when the reminder goes off have also have had a laugh.  The best part is that when I start tuning out the reminder, I can change the phrase so that it’s in my conscious again.  This app lets me look at interactions and information about my medications if I want to.  I can change the time of a single or a group of meds just for one time or even skip one or all.  I can change the looks of the meds by shapes and colors so certain ones stand out.  I can delete meds and still keep the history of the med, or even just suspend the med.

Also, the reminders to take medicine… I usually despise being notified, but for some reason the ones from Medisafe feel caring.

11241056278,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,5,Medisafe Medication Reminder,I began using a smartphone when Apple iPhone was first launched and I have found it very interesting and helpful. I have had a number of medical issues beginning in the middle of COVID lockdown. My life has changed drastically and I have had to adjust my life to accommodate my new needs. I came out of the hospital without my old iPhone. The hospital is great at saving my life and helping me accommodate my new lifestyle. I have come to realize the my world is now going to revolve around my medications and time for the rest of my life. When I began I had no guidance in choosing a medication reminder application. I began with choosing several different apps. I looked through the ratings of all the health apps in the category and found MediSafe Medication Reminder. The learning curve is pretty easy to follow. The doctors have put me on several medications and different timings. The warnings of possible drug interactions along with my doctors responses to my questions have made me adjust the timings several times. I have never been given a specific medication by my doctors that MediSafe has not been able to provide time and guidance to help me keep track on. Recently I found I have been having an issue with tracking a medication so I sent a request for help message. The next morning I had an email from MediSafe with the information answer in my mail. All I had to do was tap the plus button and my problem was solved. I have several friends who are in need of MediSafe’s help with medication tracking and reminders.

I’ve been using your app since it was first released and I'm happy to join the beta community— However, joining now will not resolve my immediate issue. I rely on the Medisafe watch app for medication reminders. Is there a way to eliminate the error messages, so that the watch app will actually work on my Series 9 watch that is running on watchOS 10.3.1? Thank you. @Business1, thank you for the positive feedback and 5 star review. We would like to invite you to join our beta community. As a beta member you'll get sneak previews on new product updates and features, as well as the opportunity to provide valuable feedback to our developers.

Even more than that, I’ve also got fairly severe depression, so taking my meds on time you could see is very paramount.

Although   the information does take some time to enter,  it’s absolutely worth it and this app will hound you and bother you until you take your meds and I love it.  I have horrible memory loss, and need the constant reminder!

I’m done with this app; it can’t keep proper track of medications and doses like it used to (I actually counted my pills to compare) - and that’s after me adjusting it for the correct count of my medications MULTIPLE times. I’m going to go back to the health app in iOS - I recommend that those who require something that will keep an accurate count do the same.

10923703519,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,4,Great App - One Pain Point,"Overall the app is great! It’s cross platform so I can use my iPhone or Android and everything syncs. It’s easy to manage medication, and even defaults to the correct picture of the medication for the dose 99% of the time! It’s really great.

The pain point…you CANNOT enter the exact time you took a medication within the hour after the scheduled time. For example, today I took my meds 1.5 hours early and forgot to record them. The notification went off to remind me, but now I cannot enter when I took the medication, it ONLY records when I hit the “Take All”, and there is no way to change it. To enter the correct time I must wait for an hour for the app to prompt me for the exact time when I hit “Take All”. This is EXTREMELY frustrating and drives me nuts.

A wish list item is to have a way to schedule meds based on duration between doses. So if I’m up early and take the first dose early, it would be nice to have the following 2 doses to be 4 hours later instead of at a specific time only. Otherwise the reminders come late or I run into the pain point above.",weiln1280,10.02.2024,us,8.3.51,0

This last one broke our schedule as it had to be taken 4 times a day with 2 hours before and after other medicines PLUS a food restriction of 1 hour before eating or 2 hours afterwards. It blew my mind. I started a time consuming diary to track of medications and eating. I found the schedule got wrecked almost every day due to activities, doctors visits or just taking badly needed nap. 
This app addresses all those issues. All her medicines scanned in. Schedules were set up. Medicines can be snoozed. I find the diary is helpful to track related information. Extra doses can be added. There are reminders though the rattle of a pill bottle sounds like a rattlesnake at first! Maybe I can change that. Haven’t looked yet.
