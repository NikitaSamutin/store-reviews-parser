12536699595,Meds & Pill Reminder MyTherapy,App Store,3,Super helpful,"I love this app, it‚Äôs better than any other ones I have tried. The notifications have not failed even once so far and the tone is unique so I immediately recognize it when I hear it and I almost never miss my medicine anymore. I also love that it tracks how many doses I have remaining. I never even come close to running out anymore. 

BUT: the one and only suggestion I have is specifically for interval medications. If I‚Äôm late on my medication, the interval should reflect that! For example, my medication is taken once weekly. If I take my dose on Wednesday, then accidentally don‚Äôt take my next dose until Tuesday (13 days later rather than 7), I should not be reminded the very next day to take it again. It should remind me 7 days later.

Anyway, aside from that issue, this is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who takes medications and/or vitamins, even if you don‚Äôt have trouble remembering to take them!",stabbycatt,13.04.2025,us,3.213.0,0

MyTherapy not only does this but it also tracks pill inventory and sets minimum on hand quantities which is a great tool to schedule refills. The monitor feature tracks a wide range of treatments or task and graphs the trends so progress is easily understood. So far I track blood sugar, blood pressure, blood oxygen, mood, pains, weight and temperature. I have met with several doctors and they all congratulate me on what a fine job I am doing keeping track of my moms health. I have been using the app for about 5 months and it has helped me so much. I can‚Äôt get over that it‚Äôs free. I would love to see a way which I can see what doctor is prescribing what so when I go to other doctors and ask who is prescribing what I can easily find that information.

Each different medicine we try has different requirements- morning or night, certain time span before or after other meds, etc. I‚Äôm already taking other meds with requirements. This plus a busy lifestyle with many other responsibilities = a brain that can‚Äôt always keep up. I‚Äôve tried taking notes on a note app, but it‚Äôs clunky to look through a list and try to keep track of everything. This app is perfect for my needs. Simple interface = quick and easy to use. I love that I get a reminder to take meds at the right time, but I get to log it at the time I actually took it. This makes it so much easier to space out the rest of my meds appropriately according to what I actually did. It also helps me remember what I did in the days before, so if I‚Äôm consistently off for a while I can slowly make it back to my normal schedule. Thank you to the developers for a great app!

11133253877,Meds & Pill Reminder MyTherapy,App Store,5,Perfectly simple,"I love this no-frills medicine tracker! I take a # of medications and supplements everyday. Before this app, it was a struggle keeping track of what to take and when, and even remembering whether or not I already took a dose (which is not good and at times surely led me to skip some). 

MyTherapy was the first app I found both easy to use and supremely practical; I‚Äôve been using it for 2-3 years now. It helps me stay on top of everything, and getting the cute/pretty picture at the end of a complete day is a nice little mood boost. 

I highly recommend this app for those with a strict regimen, especially those with memory or executive functioning issues like myself.",killeroncampus,08.04.2024,us,3.160.2,0
