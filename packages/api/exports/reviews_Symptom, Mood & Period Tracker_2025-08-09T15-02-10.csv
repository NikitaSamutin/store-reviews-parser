My only gripe is that entering nutrition is difficult and should be made easier. Nutrition factors should have prefills available depending on common meal combos. It's also almost impossible to find recently logged food items. It really needs fuzzy search and autocomplete so you can easily find previously logged items easier. My recent nutrition tags is a massive list and too hard to find things in.,Reuben Smith,08.05.2025,us,1.0.550,0
