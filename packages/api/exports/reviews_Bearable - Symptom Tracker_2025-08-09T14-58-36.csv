As someone with multiple chronic illnesses, I would absolutely invest in premium if family sharing were available. My mother and daughter both suffer as well and would benefit from this immensely- $20 is doable, $60 just is not.

12107658207,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,I replaced 12 apps w/ this ONE app that does it all better & more affordably,"I got this app because I‚Äôd heard it was good for managing chronic illness. And it very much is! Bearable has already helped me make some correlations that have improved my quality of life‚Äî things I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed on my own. 

But within this mission lie several functionalities that I was previously using multiple apps to attend to. (And it was becoming unwieldy! There comes a point when you‚Äôre spending more time setting up and updating apps than actually living your life, especially if you have some sort of executive dysfunction.) Bearable offers a multitude of functions that other apps offer as their *sole* function (and charge large monthly fees for).

And it is so entirely customizable that you can track all of your health issues in its single interface. Sleep patterns, pain, GI issues, energy, cognition, mood, allergies, heart issues, menstruation or menopause, weight loss, body measurements, hydration, dietary habits and suspected troublesome foods, exercise, autoimmune or eczema flares‚Äî anything you want to track, you can, along with potential influencing factors (again, customizable). And if it has a corollary in Apple Health, you can have the entries sync with each other. 

I also really appreciate the optional inclusion of what many other health apps leave out‚Äî social and lifestyle factors such as being outdoors (and the weather), time spent with friends/ partner/ family, screen time and video games, alcohol and caffeine intake, and any custom habits you suspect could be having an effect on your overall wellbeing. 

The yearly subscription fee is totally reasonable for this all-in-one bundle of functionality. There is a dedicated subreddit where the developer participates and is very responsive to feedback and suggestions, and where the enthusiastic user base makes it clear that this app has improved the health and lives of countless people. I‚Äôm so grateful that I found Bearable.",jellyfishgoals,26.12.2024,us,1.0.532,0

12070818094,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,"Easy, valuable, worth every penny","The free version is amazing on its own, but I'm a data junkie, so I chose to invest in a year of premium, and I haven't regretted it for a second. The value this app brings is worth every cent. Especially since I got it while it was on sale (which I hear it frequently is) for a very low price.

TL;DR - This app is highly customizable, user friendly, and feature rich. Comes with all kinds of data visualizations, simple AND advanced, for maximum insight without being hard to understand.

Life changing:
- Detailed insights allow me to identify triggers, patterns, and other data that can provide insight on my symptoms. I can see who has the most positive impact on my life, which habits are truly serving their purpose, and whether any new medications are actually improving my symptoms. PLUS I can see which symptom management techniques are most effective, what time of day or day of the week I feel worst, and how my symptoms fluctuate over time. And more!
- The app provides suggestions for the best ways to manage your symptoms and the worst triggers to avoid, based on data from past logs. You can also input your own symptom management strategies for bad days. 
- Built-in (optional) medication tracking and reminders help me stay on top of which meds I take when, and make sure I never miss a day.
- Optional nutrition and water tracking also allows you to stay on top of your health and make sure you're meeting your needs. (I don't personally use this feature, but I can think of a thousand ways this could be helpful for other users.)

Practical upsides:
- User-friendly and easy to understand. I figured it out and set it up quickly.
- VERY customizable to allow the user to measure and track whatever you'd like, going as simple or in depth as your heart desires.
- Customizable reminders for the best times of day that work for you.
- Simple AND advanced data visualization at any time to best suit your needs.
- Low friction; it's so easy and simple to log symptoms that I find myself naturally doing it 5-10 times a day without reminders. Just tap a button and you're golden. 
- Community focused developers who take suggestions from the users and work hard to make the app better and better. Public suggestion forum includes information on plans for future changes.

Cons:
- Mood is rated on a scale of 1-10 and can be logged as many times per day as you'd like, but other symptoms are rated 0-4 and only up to 4 times per day in time blocks that are not customizable. I personally only care to rate my energy levels in detail, so I was able to work around this by just using the mood tracking section for energy levels instead. But this could be an issue for others.
- Due to the small development team, updates and new features may be slow.
- Does not currently have a built-in menstrual cycle tracker. (But it may in the future?)

 I personally set mine up kinda Willy-Nilly in the beginning, and while still acting as a  good self-accountability tool, I was not using the features of the app to my fullest advantage.

For example, the app syncs with Apple Health so I can see patterns between my symptoms, the meds, and how well I sleep. I use it at the end of the day to rate them and then the app analyzes and reports weekly on what factors most affect my mood, symptoms and sleep. I especially appreciate the new Self discoveries section where I can reflect on what improves or triggers my symptoms, all supported with ""hints"" of correlations and trends from the data I have recorded.

It has been ok for keeping track of things (although I‚Äôd like to track my symptom onset time with more specificity than 6 hour blocks), but not great for insights. First of all, their correlations grid does not give correlation values, and while that probably doesn‚Äôt bother most people, the results and conclusions can be misleading. Also, the 6 hour blocks in which things are tracked make it impossible to discover / distinguish for example migraine symptoms vs. migraine warning signs vs. migraine triggers because I don‚Äôt know in what order they happened, just that they all happened in ‚ÄúMID‚Äù. The data will still be good for analyzing other larger daily patterns though, like whether my migraines are related to allergies. ~~ I finally downloaded all my data to analyze it myself, and discovered there‚Äôs no way to get *all* of your data because it doesn‚Äôt export when you marked a symptom as ‚Äúnone‚Äù (even they know that unmeasured is not the same as 0, which is why their ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù analysis page encourages you to mark symptoms as none when they‚Äôre not active instead of leaving them blank).

Aside from that, it has taken SO much stress out of my health tracking due to it being easy to use, insightful, and reliable. I would recommend this to anyone looking to improve their well being! 

The only reasons I gave this app 3 stars are;

1) The app isn‚Äôt the best when you are stuck behind a paywall. After paying, the app is stellar! I just hate subscriptions though and I wish I could pay once and be done with it. I don‚Äôt mind paying to support the creators of such a great app, it‚Äôs just not ideal that I am going to need to budget over $30+ for this for years. Considering that it‚Äôs a yearly payment instead of a monthly, that does help! However, as a girl on a tight budget, it‚Äôs not the easiest for me. 

2) This app doesn‚Äôt include menstrual cycle tracking, which would be SOOOO incredibly useful! My cycle/hormones have a BIG affect on my other health problems. It‚Äôs hard to keep track of the correlations between my health problems and where I am at in my cycle, and it would save me a lot of time if Bearable had a cycle tracking section that could show insights and correlations to/with everything else I track in the app. I use Stardust instead for cycle tracking (awesome app btw) but it is time consuming and somewhat difficult to go through each app and dig through entires to find correlations. I would feel much better about paying for this app if it included cycle tracking (especially since it affects around 50% of the populations health).",Kennedy Orange,19.09.2024,us,1.0.518,0

The older I get, the worse I feel physically, which in turn impacts my emotional wellbeing. It‚Äôs been difficult to face these challenges alone and I was pretty resistant to using Bearable when I first began because it has SO many metrics to keep track of. 

While this is a plus of the app, I was concerned it would be too overwhelming for me to learn. Fortunately that wasn‚Äôt the case. 

So far I‚Äôve found it very easy to use and I truly appreciate the levels of tracking (low detail, medium detail, and high detail). This ‚Äúlow bar"" to entry and the helpful tips built into the app helped me overcome anxiety and avoidance as I endeavor to improve my overall health.

11380862924,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,"Amazing, dynamic app","This app is very dynamic, and it‚Äôs getting more and more so. You have many options of ways to handle tracking your health. The devs are kind and helpful and so interactive with the community. They ask for feedback on designs and ideas and listen when people ask for certain features. 

This is the best health tracking app I‚Äôve come across in my years of searching. 

As a minor suggestion for the devs:
Since your app‚Äôs strength is how many ways it can be used, there are some little changes that would increase that greatly. 

- Allow custom rating systems for symptoms and other things. (e.g 1-10/3-46 or whatever other number scale versus a type in option versus an emoji option etc). You already have all of these features but only certain features can use it (only heath measurements can use type in, only symptoms can use 1-4 etc). If all the features that it makes sense for could be customized as to what they‚Äôre using the app would be much more dynamic.

-Allow us to further customize our homepage. I would like to be able to group things together that aren‚Äôt necessarily from the same feature.

11377454060,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,THE BEST Symptom Tracker for chronic illness,"I take a whole laundry list of meds that change frequently, and I just found out I'm autistic, and I have been battling major depression, PTSD, and anxiety for years. I also have chronic migraines from a severe head injury. Because of my autism, it's been difficult to communicate how I'm doing to my therapists and psychiatrists and doctors, and often I was not believed about the severity of my symptoms, or accused of not taking my medication, or told that my sleep or energy is better than I think it is. Now I have EMPIRICAL DATA all gathered in one place that provides an accurate assessment of my moods, symptoms both mental and physical, everything all in one place. My only complaint is that I wish you could time stamp EVERYTHING, not just medication times and mood and energy but also factors and symptoms instead of being limited to 4 time ranges because I'd like to see if a short-term intervention works and right now I can only see that I listen to relaxing music when I get anxious, but not whether I feel less anxious after listening to relaxing music.

2.

Much cheaper price for the new one and gross - thanks for charging twice as much a few months ago and telling me you ripped me off.

3. Try to access account info and they have a touchscreen button for account icon and email that usually would take you into those details on other platforms but this one it ‚Äòinstantly restored‚Äô premium without any confirmation this was going to happen or choice. It‚Äôs very misleading.

It's been over 6  months of using Bearable and it's everything I've always wanted in a health tracking app. I've used several health tracking, todo, mood tracking apps and this has by far exceeded all my expectations.

I love how customizable and flexible it is! Many apps don't even allow you to add your own tags. I also love how simple the app is, no frills. Design wise ‚Äì it's so easy to grok and read. The colors are just right and not overwhelming. Even though there's a ton of things going on in this app, it's easy to navigate. 

Love that it syncs to Apple health. I'm able to also connect other data (e.g. Oura data) from Apple Health to Bearable so I have all my health metrics in one place.

I use this mainly to track factors/medication affecting my anxiety/depression but it's also become a habit tracker! I love that I can use the calendar view to see how many days I've done a certain ""factor"" or action. Doing this daily also just helps me be present and reflect on my day in a quick and accesible way! 

The insights are not as helpful for me but I'd say that about any health tracking app ‚Äì the obvious things are always true (exercise, eat well, get sun, sleep well, etc) but it's nice to see the trends over time in case you're going through some big life changes.

I decided to invest in Bearable because anxiety had begun leaving me completely unable to function every single day ‚Äî like literally spent a week in bed just incessantly panicking. Cue setting up Bearable, painstakingly inputting every detail I could think of. I found after several months of use that many of the things that I thought were ‚Äúright‚Äù were actually leaving me in absolute wreckage, while my partner and his family were consistently bring my mood up SUBSTANTIALLY. Seeing the numbers laid out encouraged me to make the difficult decision of leaving what I now identify was a cult. It helped me cut ties with abusive situations that had trapped my family for generations. It helped me learn what joy was after years of hospital visits, SH episodes, panic attacks, and starvation.

The problem is when applications capture the same set of data, do it manually, and don‚Äôt collaborate.

Despite a lengthy privacy policy assuring you they aren't doing anything shady, at the very bottom it tells you that they're giving your email address to Facebook and Google to ""find more customers like you"", so be sure to sign up with Apple and use the ""hide email"" feature.

The onboarding is well-intentioned but annoying (far too long due to an unnecessary, unskippable ""customization"" questionnaire). It can supposedly import data like heart rate from Health but it's not in there by default, does not ask during onboarding, and how to sync it is unclear. The UI is visually attractive but not intuitive, and it needs a lot of work on the usability front-- for example, you cannot close the 'choose the main symptoms you want to track' window without closing the entire app. It's also one of those """"""free"""""" apps that are actually unusable after the subscription trial period, because the entire insights tab is paywalled.

I can do bowel movements and mood, but I have to generalize the symptoms in buckets throughout the day. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out what‚Äôs been causing my fatigue for the past 2 years and having the option to track more granular trends in time would be very very helpful.

10879618880,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,A godsend for tracking complex health matters,"In the process of trying to tend to multiple overlapping short- and long- term physical and mental health matters, including a challenging diagnostic path for a possible rare genetic condition, I realized that keeping a notes file with general observations wasn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. It became abundantly clear that I‚Äôm going to need much more granular data to not only help parse my complicated presentation, but also to advocate for myself with providers and insurance. I researched multiple health and lifestyle tracking apps before landing on Bearable and giving it a trial week. I didn‚Äôt need a week, though ‚Äî It was clear on the same day that I downloaded it that it was a keeper. 

Bearable offers a flexible system for tracking not just symptoms but a whole range of lifestyle factors that influence wellbeing. Its default set-up is pretty robust to start with and may serve many users well without much tweaking. That said, it was super easy and intuitive to use its defaults as a jumping off point for adding custom factors to track (i.e. very specific symptoms such as left hand tingling/numbness vs right, and daily activities specific to my life, like how much VR headset use). 

After you get a few days logged, the app starts to provide correlations between the tracked items. While correlation isn‚Äôt causation, seeing these connections offers plenty of insight to allow for greater self-awareness and to help guide inquiries to providers. In under a week it has given me new awareness of some semi-regular activities that appear to positively impact my mental health, so now I can explore the connection intentionally. Never would have put two and two together on my own. 

Perhaps the best part is discovering how much the (small!) Bearable team works with its users to make further developments. Multiple platforms exist to interact with the community of Bearable users and the creators, where requests and ideas are shared and bounced back and forth with the creators as they make developments. I‚Äôve never seen a company walk the talk SO thoroughly on their commitment to being user driven. 

This might be a weirdly long and effusive review üòÖ, but it‚Äôs impacted me that much.

Thank you so much, Bearable team. Your app, and your palpable care, have given me a practice tool *and* a dash of empowerment and optimism about my own health. üíó",JJMK27,30.01.2024,us,1.0.483,0

10842012969,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,3,"A lot more app than I expected, yet also less","I saw that Apple Health added the ability to track an assortment of symptoms, and I have the occasional headache or stuffy nose ‚Ä¶ so I went looking for an app which might simplify my ability to record my symptoms to Apple Health.

I suppose what I visualized was my telling the app ‚ÄúOh, I have a headache!‚Äù and the app asking me ‚ÄúHow bad is it?‚Äù and my telling it ‚ÄúMild,‚Äù and the app saying ‚ÄúShall I ask you again in an hour how you‚Äôre feeling?‚Äù and my saying ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and the app waiting an hour and then asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù and my saying ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve been feeling fine for 15 minutes,‚Äù and the app replying ‚ÄúOkay then!‚Äù and recording into Apple Health ‚ÄúHeadache - mild; from 1:10 to 1:55 p.m. on so-and-so date.‚Äù If I was lucky, I thought the app might also record to Apple Health that I‚Äôd taken two acetaminophen.

But mostly I just wanted it to write my symptoms to Apple Health, so that other apps could read them from there, or so that I might include symptoms ‚Äî and their time and date ‚Äî in an overall printout of Apple Health for my doctor, elementary stuff.

This app is not that!! This app is so-o-o-o-oo detailed, like it gets really granular in terms of the things it tracks and charts. If you‚Äôre inclined to record a lot of data into it, I suppose it could help you spot correlations between symptoms and the events surrounding those symptoms. It seems designed for people with truly debilitating chronic illnesses, who may need help narrowing down exactly what‚Äôs making their lives so unlivable.

And it may be great for people with debilitating chronic illness ‚Äî I would not know, I‚Äôm a pretty healthy dude who intended to be a casual user. For me, for what little I needed, this app quickly overwhelmed me ‚Ä¶ and the subscription price, ye cats! For my intended casual level of use, this kind of pricing seems stratospheric. So it may be great for some people, but it‚Äôs not the app for me.

All of that being said, though, I‚Äôm quite surprised it DOES NOT sync symptoms to Apple Health. That‚Äôs quite an oversight. I wish apps which sync with Apple Health were required to specify in their App Store description what info it is exactly that they sync: this would save users lots of time. This app does READ a tremendous amount of info FROM Apple Health, but it does NOT write your symptoms TO Apple Health.

So I give it three stars in terms of its utility to me: it looks like it works, it‚Äôs extraordinarily detailed, it‚Äôs just not what I need right now, and it does NOT do the one thing I‚Äôd hoped it would do. But for you, if you have a life-upending chronic illness, it may be a five-star app or even a six-star app. Luckily for me I‚Äôm in good shape, and to be honest, I hope I continue NOT needing this app.

If the day comes that I do, though, I would still be disappointed if they hadn‚Äôt added the ability to WRITE symptoms TO Apple Health for possible integration with other apps; this seems like the whole point of having a centralized repository of health information!",Ricky Tenderkiss,20.01.2024,us,1.0.481,0
10821677700,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,4,"Love it, wish there were two additional features","I have been looking for an app like this for AGES and imagine my surprise when an Instagram add pointed me towards one that actually works. This is what data should be for. It takes away so much stress for me that I don‚Äôt have to be the one trying to unpack what is leading to chronic pain flare ups, I can just be diligent about logging everything in and it would give me metrics. 

This is such a helpful app I‚Äôd like to hope that maybe the creators would take some suggestions from people who have benefited from using it and add two features: a food log and the ability to enter periods of disrupted sleep. I‚Äôd like to see if there‚Äôs an association between WHAT I eat and how I feel and it would be really useful to be able to keep that in the same app. I‚Äôd also like to be able to indicate in the app if I was awake between 4am-5am, rather than only be able to list the total time from when I initially went to sleep to when I started my day, as I think that makes a huge difference in how I feel the next day.

Tracking my food too to make sure I eat despite forgetting and the nausea and the appetite being gone. It has the ability to remind you to do things. Take medicine for example. Tracking my many symptoms too. Even the little gratitude tracker is a nice bonus. And the mood tracker is a nice bonus to have me consciously think about how I‚Äôm feeling emotionally not just physically. All of it is brilliant. I love that I can add in my own symptoms and my own emotions, for when I feel ennui or emotionally energized or on fire or proud, or symptoms like ‚Äòsenility‚Äô or other things that don‚Äôt come pre-set. It‚Äôs all just so incredible and I could go on and on. I wish I could pay for it to use all its goodness but the free version is nice too. Just to track what I do.

9951694833,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,3,Missing some common sense features,"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a tracking app that combines rich app-generated insights with maximum user customizability. Bearable nails the first; their analysis is comprehensive and user-friendly‚Äîthough without the ability to share or export insights, they hinder users‚Äô ability to maximize the usefulness of those insights.  

Bearable is also great at building in the ability for users to customize *what* they track. Where the app falls short on user customization though is in *how* we track. This includes customizing the mood scale, colors, rating levels (none-unbearable), whether a factor is considered positive or negative in the analysis, and whether it makes sense for a symptom or factor to have multiple ratings/day or have it apply to the whole day (e.g., a symptom like acne or a factor like ‚Äúout of town‚Äù doesn‚Äôt change 4 times a day). 

But these are relatively minor and non-disruptive to tracking compared to my biggest issue here: not being able to modify the time windows on which all tracking is based. (For non-Bearable users, these are 12am-6am, 6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, and 6pm-12am.) As a ‚Äúnight owl,‚Äù it feels like a huge chunk of data is missing because the default times assume my day ends at midnight. Including those symptoms or factors in the 12am-6am window for the following day messes with that day‚Äôs average and is inaccurate. I never wake up before 6am, so I never put anything in the ‚Äúpre‚Äù box, meaning I‚Äôm only really tracking 18 hours of the day, with everything that happens from 12am-bedtime completely left out. I‚Äôve considered mentally changing the time windows but that would be incredibly inconvenient for an app I‚Äôm paying a subscription for.

9627194719,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,4,Perfect aside from one shortcoming,"This app is ALMOST perfect. I use it to track things like productivity, mood, health, and energy so i can better understand what habits or routines I need to change in order to manage my ADHD, IBS, etc. 
HOWEVER, because one of my primary symptoms is executive disfunction I have a hard time pushing myself to open the app everyday, throughout the day, go down the list, recall my symptoms + factors, and record them. I have two notes for developers that would make Bearable more friendly to those of us who struggle with executive disfunction and probably more usable for people in the long term. 
1.) Home Screen or Lock Screen WIDGETS where you can quickly record energy levels, fatigue, productivity, mood, etc. in real time without having to track down the app on your Home Screen. 
2.) APPLE WATCH APP?? My phone isn‚Äôt always on me and i avoid using it during the day as it leads to distraction. But my watch is always on my wrist and if I‚Äôm feeling low or have a sudden onslaught of dread etc. it would be nice to just click my wrist and record that. Oftentimes, I‚Äôm feeling off but never end up recording that in Bearable because I either forget I felt that way or I‚Äôm too fatigued to go through the motions of doing it on my phone. 
I currently use another app to do this on my watch but it doesn‚Äôt track as much as Bearable and the data aren‚Äôt as informative, but I‚Äôm a lot more inclined to use it just for the convenience. 
My partner is a software engineer and said he could program it for you üòÖ But I trust you have your own people to do that!

9627151002,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,Very customizable to your individual needs!!,"I have tried various apps to track different health concerns throughout the past 10 years or so, and this is the most comprehensive app that I‚Äôve used. I love the detail that they put in the data options for each different ‚Äútopic‚Äù. A great example of that is the bowl movement section. They provide different stool types to chose from, with a ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù image of each type, and they even provide the options in order from hardest to softest types, with a description too. You can also choose common notes, such as the urgency and difficulty, and others. Plus, you can add your own notes to each topic. So when I changed my diet to include more oatmeal, or more exercise, I noted how those affected my digestive system. It‚Äôs as if they took the concerns and medically helpful suggestions and included them in each topic that they provide for you to track.

Other things that I, personally, use the app for right now are my possible MS symptoms, such as tingling in my hands and feet, exhaustion, and mental focus, just to name a few. But I also track headaches, tired days, nutrition (general, I don‚Äôt track exactly what I ate and how much, etc. But I can note specifics when I desire, such as consuming a food that is high in a certain nutrient.)

There‚Äôs a lot more that I‚Äôm not thinking of right now.

I have pretty high expectations for the abilities of an app, and this is one that I felt like is worth taking the time to right a detailed review. I hope that it is helpful to others.",Wasted money!!,17.02.2023,us,1.0.440,0

I focus on my productivity and achievements so much that I neglect my health sometimes, and I want to fix that. My favorite thing about this app is logging my symptoms every day as well as what I eat and other factors such as sleep and weather, and every week it will show a report of correlations and I can adjust accordingly. It is nice to be able to have this data to show my doctors as well.

8402817006,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,3,The results are not accurate or trustworthy,"This app could have been phenomenal, but there are too many glitches that make me not trust the results. I have spent a lot of time these past few days inputting all my foods and symptoms. Since I was intending to spend a lot of time each week doing this, I wanted to make sure the app was reliable, so I did a few experiments. For example, if you go back in time and delete a specific food from a previous day, then at the bottom of the Insights page, where the factors are listed, the little number in the upper right hand corner of that food factor does not get updated. Like, let‚Äôs say there were previously four instances of that food and you reduce it to three, there is still a tiny ‚Äúfour‚Äú attached that food. And yet it does delete it from the day where you deleted it. Then if you look at the impact that food has on your sleep, the percentage of ‚Äúeffect‚Äú does change a bit (As it should) compared to when you had 4 instances of that food but what‚Äôs weird and really bad is that if you then create an imaginary food (just for the sake of this experiment) and you put it on the exact same three days as this first food you just tested, the results are not the same, whereas they should be. Since there are three instances of these two foods and they are on the exact same three days at exactly the same time, and the only difference between them is that the first food was reduced from 3 to 4 instances and the second food was logged in as three instances from scratch with no corrections, the results should be the same. But they‚Äôre not. So why should I trust the results in general? If the results are not trustworthy, this is a huge problem, and this is a very important glitch that should be fixed. I really hope that you will fix it because other than its inaccuracy and unreliability it‚Äôs a truly phenomenal app with the potential to improve peoples‚Äô lives immeasurably.

I have the ability to remove stuff that doesn‚Äôt matter to me, and create some oddly specific categories that I doubt I could find anywhere else.

It also helps to have everything in one place. I have memory problems, but I need to track a few different symptoms, medications taken, medication side effects, sleep logging, digestive health, and a food journal. It is hard to keep up with all of that, but this app has widgets to log all of these things and more.

There are sections to track daily factors, stress, energy levels, mood, mental health, weather, menstruation, extra notes, and more. It can be as simple or as detailed as you want to make it. Bearable is also synced with my iOS health app, so it automatically logs sleep, heart rate, and step count measurements from my Apple watch.

Is this supplement actually making a difference?
*******
For self improvement addicts like myself or anyone struggling with mental or physical health, Bearable is an AWESOME way to record interventions like new meds and supplements and different activities or exercises to see how they affect energy and happiness on average over the long term.

There can be an awfully confusing matrix of variables playing a role in mental (and physical!) health, from social media to sleep to weather to specific places we go daily and people we see, and Bearable lets you track ALL of these. You just type them in and the app works in the background making associations (‚Äòinsights‚Äô) for you over time and showing you patterns you might not otherwise see.

They have truly thought of everything - and anything else you think of, you can add yourself! Every category is customizable - you can both add options and take away ones you don‚Äôt use. 

For instance I added Sugar Cravings to my Symptoms list and was able to see I have Fatigue 100% of the time I have sugar cravings. This is not surprising but it‚Äôs a great reminder to see in black and white that when my brain says chocolate, what I really need is a nap.

I haven‚Äôt even grazed the real depths of what this app can do in my first month using it and I look forward to exploring more of its capabilities and insights. 

I can‚Äôt think of any condition this app wouldn‚Äôt be super helpful for - weight control, depression, PMDD, anxiety, addiction recovery, migraines, chronic fatigue - and it‚Äôs great at keeping everything in one face with a fun, friendly, motivating user interface. 

I just want to say THANK YOU to the developers. I have dreamed of an app like Bearable for as long as there have been apps. I‚Äôve used various trackers to monitor mood, health factors and habits for years but I can bring everything under one roof now.",Uhaulmyass,03.11.2021,us,1.0.291,0

7970535262,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,4,The best I‚Äôve found,"I‚Äôve scoured the appstore and tried numerous apps for health and symptom tracking - I can‚Äôt find anything better than Bearable. The dev is responsive and releases frequent tweaks, fixes and upgrades. Privacy is a cornerstone - if you think about it, you probably DON‚ÄôT want an app scraping your most personal info and selling it to the highest bidder, right? Bearable is free to download but to really use it isn‚Äôt free - most apps these days aren‚Äôt - but the subscription is at least reasonable. Some similar apps do MUCH less and cost MUCH more. (Gyroscope, I‚Äôm looking at YOU.) Nothing is really free, but hey, I like to be paid for my work and I assume devs do as well. FWIW, I loathe subscriptions, but Bearable is one of the very few that I renew with no hesitation. Bearable is comprehensive and flexible - you can add or remove almost anything and track it according to frequency, intensity and quantity. You can hide stuff but keep it in the database - for example, if your allergies tend to flare up in the spring and fall but not the rest of the year, you can hide the entry from the main input screen and limit the clutter. I haven‚Äôt really figured out the data manipulation part yet - the app apparently does all kinds of data gymnastics, but I haven‚Äôt wrapped my head around that part. Bearable is unfortunately currently only available for iPhone. I‚Äôm not as young as I used to be - my eyes aren‚Äôt the best and I have sausages for fingers. find the small screen clumsy and unfriendly for graphs, charts and comparisons. I‚Äôd really like to see a native (landscape!) iPad app that would either sync via iCloud or allow data export/import from iPhone. Finally, while you can manually enter weather data, it would also be great to have the app automatically sync local temp, cloud cover, humidity, etc. in the same way that Bearable can already collect blood pressure, weight and such from HealthKit. Bottom line: it‚Äôs closer to perfect than any other app I‚Äôve tried in this category or any other tracker I‚Äôve tried to wrangle into working.",Left0verture,30.10.2021,us,1.0.291,0

This app is very detailed, which helps me because my health issues can sometimes be very subtle. They also have been evolving over time, and Bearable is able to keep up with all of that. It also allows for customization, which helps me make the app fit *me,* as opposed to me having to fit the app. 

The free version of this app offers A LOT, as well. Very generous of them. I‚Äôm glad I finally upgraded to Premium, but if you are unsure or on a tight budget, you can still track a ton of things with the free version. 

I am not a tech-minded person, so I appreciate how well thought out the design of this app is. I was able to get going quickly. Everything is very user-friendly. Also, I recently hit a glitch that turned out to stem from Apple, but when I first reached out to Bearable, they answered quickly.

7815265941,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,5,Spoon Saver & Complex Illness Savior,"I‚Äôve used a lot of different health trackers in an attempt to get a better grip on my complex chronic illness. The problem with most apps and methods is they either lack the ability to customize the app to my specific needs or they require way too many spoons to use. Bearable is not like any other health tracker. 

I have 14 doses of meds per day and a litany of symptoms, triggers, and environmental factors that I need to track everyday. Bearable let‚Äôs me do that! Not only can I totally customize what I actually track but it takes less than 5 minutes to record everything I need to. 

Now when my doctors or medical practitioners ask about my medication adherence or symptom/trigger management I‚Äôm able to answer definitively. It‚Äôs also very helpful to be able to add major events and daily notes because brain fog will often make me completely forget when something impactful happened or what weird symptom I wanted to ask my doc about.

Overall, I cannot recommend Bearable enough. Especially if you have complex chronic illness and/or are disabled. EDS, POTS, MCAS, and etcetera are extremely difficult conditions to manage but Bearable makes it so much easier.",claraj0rdan,17.09.2021,us,1.0.247,0

7805670046,Bearable - Symptom Tracker,App Store,3,Works amazing but needs easier food tracking,"This app works really good and I wanted to love it especially with having paid for premium, but unfortunately a large amount of the symptoms I face are related to food. While I can customize the app for things like ‚Äòhigh sugar‚Äô etc, in my case this doesn‚Äôt help because I can‚Äôt discern any pattern in the foods that make me ill and being able to look at all the ingredients as patterns is essential. There just isn‚Äôt an easy way to do this and manually entering each ingredient is too time consuming to realistically do every meal. This is a huge factor and if I need to use another app like lifesum or myfitnesspal to track food it largely defeats the purpose of this app since I have to manually compare anyways-I‚Äôll for now just stick to sticky notes :/ Which is a bummer because I really really want an app that is all in one for symptoms or food-all the apps I‚Äôve found seem to be only one or the other. 

For now I‚Äôve stopped using it for those reasons.  Overall though I can say I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone who is struggling with health issues unrelated to food. It works amazing for that.",Apostate_Mage,14.09.2021,us,1.0.247,0

It‚Äôs a person who struggles with ADHD, depression and anxiety, I often have mood fluctuations and have no idea how to gain perspective on the issue. This app allows me to stay in touch with the bigger picture which helps me feel grounded.
I really love how many different points of data that you are able to add to this app. It is so convenient and satisfying to sync my sleep tracking app with this app so I can see how my sleep relates to my mood. Seeing how seamless this integration is makes me really really want to have more of my Apple health data sync with this app. I have an Apple Watch and constantly am curious of how things like my steps and exercise minutes factor into my mood. I feel that this integration would be so simple to include and would make this app a lot more robust.

 I also want to encourage the developers of this app to make an Apple Watch version so I can quickly input my mood on my watch. I have wanted to do this on countless different occasions because it would be such an easy way to input the data, but have to wait until I can pull my phone out instead. 

Overall, excellent app that simply tracks so many different things, but it‚Äôs only limited by the number of automatically synced integrations. If this app could sync with my Apple health data with more detail, I would give this five stars.",Booberrox392,23.08.2021,us,1.0.247,0

Yesterday I wrote a long, significant note early in the day, then later it was gone. I haven‚Äôt figured out a pattern, except it‚Äôs consistently terrible using voice to text. Sometimes sleep sync works fine, sometimes doesn‚Äôt show up for a couple days, sometimes never (tracked using Garmin or Sleep Cycle).

I felt compelled to leave a review as I typically fall off the wagon with these kinds of things, but I‚Äôm consistently using this app after a month. I I can‚Äôt speak to what Bearable does or doesn‚Äôt do in comparison with others, because I never made it past the initial steps with the other apps and got frustrated with too many options and the general inflexibility (made me feel like I had to figure out exactly what I wanted to track right then and there when life just isn‚Äôt like that). Bearable has a ton of ways to customize that can seem overwhelming, but you can also initially hide those categories and track the most important stuff first and add in other factors and symptoms as time goes on.

I really like that it integrates with apple health and I really love that the developer is very open to feedback and sharing about features that are in the works. Integration with Fitbit would be great, but for now syncing my Fitbit info to apple health with FitSync is working absolutely fine. Bearable automatically grabs the info.

It also helps me realize that setbacks I face throughout my day (and would ordinarily obsess about) are just little blips.  I can see that despite my panic attack the day is still good, it hasn‚Äôt been completely ruined. It‚Äôs been very helpful for me to have something visualizes that so well.
