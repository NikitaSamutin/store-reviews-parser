I‚Äôve looked at the menu on their website and I‚Äôve scrolled down to the bottom of the page for the usual contact and about section. They just doesn‚Äôt seem to be information readily available on privacy. I would think that a product like this would be screaming about privacy and data sharing. Maybe they have it somewhere but it shouldn‚Äôt be this difficult to find for a savvy app user. I haven‚Äôt researched if they‚Äôve had any data of breaches yet, but I will be doing that next. it‚Äôs great that they highlight how robust their features are, but they focus on that over privacy is a concern to me. I took a screenshot of the bottom of the webpage links, but I‚Äôm not able to post it. I encourage people to look at this section before using because there is no highlight or mention of privacy and that is such a red flag, considering this is a healthcare app. Edited to add viewing on mobile site (iOS) via Brave, Safari, and Chrome and that their privacy statement can be found via a web search but it is woefully lacking. For instance, it states a bit about using Google credentials, yet it doesn‚Äôt state anything about using FB credentials, etc. it is a scant, boilerplate statement with holes.

Later in the day I recorded a workout on my watch yet it never showed up in my reports. So I did another workout and watched and waited. I used the manual back up and sync button but still nothing showed up. I did another out the next day and nothing is showing up. I sent screenshots to their team and explained all of the things that I‚Äôve tried and what I‚Äôm seeing and I‚Äôve gotten no help whatsoever back up and only works for back up to their cloud.

11038555551,"Tracker, Reminder - CareClinic",App Store,5,Best App for data with medications and health; pros and cons list,"Pros: it‚Äôs affordable! Most apps you have to pay any was and this is about 10 a month or 60 a year some apps really over charge you but this is a good price. Besides my con about to many prices it‚Äôs fine for them to ask for payment. 

-you can set reminders to take medication and it does every other ones too like you can set the reminders to what ever times you needs or dates or if you need to take something only a few weeks you can set an end date You can check in with any symptoms or medication you need. Anything you are feeling you can record and it puts the date time, and you can do multiple at once 

- There‚Äôs logs charts and trends. The charts and trends don‚Äôt show until after about a month of using give or take. But that‚Äôs to be expected for any chart, it needs time to collect the data. You can set up a plan of medications symptoms , nutrition, activity therapy mood weather for pollen and temperature , sleep and many more even stool! (Which sounds gross but it‚Äôs really important) There‚Äôs goals conditions a care team and much more 

- This is all with the paid additions but the free one still have medications and a few others which is fair.  

-Cons: I wish there were tutorials somewhere to help navigate the app like either when you first download it or a link to YouTube , there is an area with explanations but it‚Äôs all words it does not show you, it‚Äôs pretty much a community forum. 

-  I feel like there should be trial with pay after a certain day maybe a coupon one and a regular one or have certain promotions at certain times because it is confusing they have 7 plans but some don‚Äôt make sense. 

-And maybe have videos of upcoming additions or what‚Äôs changing or bug fixes, like a larger social media presence or even emails. People like that stuff at least I do. 

 Besides that I don‚Äôt really have anything to complain about. It‚Äôs helped me tremendously and it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúpretty‚Äù as other apps but it‚Äôs data filled and that‚Äôs what counts for me and a lot of others. It puts me in the right path. I am grateful for this app. Yes the charts are just lines and a little hard to read but still nice to have the information 

Conclusion this app isn‚Äôt for lazy people it‚Äôs for people who want to keep details or medications symptoms and their life. You can custom the front to read how you like it. The medications even show drug interactions. The charts and trends need a little work but are fine and I‚Äôve had no problems with my data disappearing. Maybe add an option to download your dating to your phone or cloud by month or every three months if you want just in case? Or email it option so people can share with health care providers or family or keep for them selves.

However 2 days into using it some of my symptoms disappeared from my check in list, and in the history those symptoms had changed to different and random names. Like instead of my custom ‚Äúneck pain‚Äù it said ‚Äúculpa‚Äù. The whole point of this app was historic record, but if I can‚Äôt trust it then what good is it?

*update to developer response*
I certainly appreciate that the developer responded, so that‚Äôs a plus. I do like to keep these interactions public though.

It wasn‚Äôt a single check in that didn‚Äôt save, but multiple symptoms that I had used in multiple checklist that completely rewrote themselves to be called other things with no input from me, and further deleted themselves as options from my custom list.

Again, I appreciate the willingness to debug, but since the whole point was to have an indelible record, I just cannot gamble on a debug and hope.",UntoldGlory,06.03.2024,us,5.70,0

Dear App Developer, I hope this message finds you well. I have your application on my Apple device and I've been encountering some issues that have persisted throughout the year.The yearly subscription is now up. Despite numerous attempts to resolve these issues with your support rep, I continue to experience data loss within the app. I have requested my data to no avail. It is all gone. The app only shows what I entered during the free trial phrase from January 2023. This has significantly impacted my user experience and has caused considerable inconvenience to the data I had for my doctors to review. Given the circumstances, I believe it would be fair to request a complimentary one-year subscription to your service, as a goodwill gesture for the troubles I've experienced. I look forward to your prompt response and assistance in resolving these issues. Best regards, Susan",kyswh,01.03.2024,us,5.70,0

If I want my data backed up and synced, that should be an option that I choose, not forced on me by making me create an account on your servers just to evaluate the app. I would think you‚Äôd want to make it as easy as possible for people to try your app, decide whether it‚Äôs for them, and then create an account if so.

9258389428,"Tracker, Reminder - CareClinic",App Store,4,Great app with some glitches,"I‚Äôve tried other apps in the past for symptom tracking, but I‚Äôve come to love this app because of how much it allows you to track. Symptoms, nutrition, fluids, bowl movements, influencing factors, sleep, meds taken, measurements (like weight, heart rate, BP) activities (I use that feature to track my meditation, affirmations, exercising, doctors appointments, upright time and etc.)  It can be used for medication reminders as well.

The app also generates lots of options for reports! You can compare your symptoms to the meds taken, or the activities done that day, track symptoms to food eaten, track mood to meditation - there are SO many options. This helps you see what all may be impacting your symptoms so you can manage things better. You can also print out reports for your doctor. 

There is a 7 Day free trial for the app, but then it is subscription based. The subscription cost of the app is $5 per month or 59.99 per year. For me, the cost is worth it since I‚Äôm working really hard to try to figure out the cause of my neurological symptoms.

The app even allows you to store lots of information including your care team, labs, vaccines and etc.

There are some cons to the app that could be improved upon. The biggest con, is that the app is slow to update once you make an entry. It seems to take a good 30-60 seconds or so to upload the new information to the log. Also some of the factors I put in, do not save and I have to add the factor each time I want to use it. This is a bug that needs fixed. Additionally, there are some parts of the app that you can‚Äôt input the information at a later time. Mostly you can. For example, if you forgot to record meds or symptoms, you can add them later, but some parts don‚Äôt allow this. I can‚Äôt input my BP and Pulse for the day before, for example, because it doesn‚Äôt give the the option to change the date like it does for meds or symptoms.

When I clicked the much smaller, less visible option to ‚ÄúSkip,‚Äù a pop-up said, ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to skip upgrading to premium? You may not get access to it later!‚Äù 

 I chose ‚ÄúSkip upgrade‚Äù and was taken to a new page to ‚ÄúCreate Plan‚Äù that explained ‚ÄúA Care Plan will help you track Medications, Activity, Symptoms, & More. Start by selecting the Type then select your chronic conditions if any. Tap ‚ÄòCreate‚Äô when done.‚Äù But once again the page failed to load, just that little circle spinning forever.

8044960350,"Tracker, Reminder - CareClinic",App Store,2,Looked promising but‚Ä¶,"1) Buggy and slow - images flash when you switch screens, screens take a while to load (even with next to no information) 

2) Seems useless for fasting so far - I added a supplement, but it isn‚Äôt tracked in the ‚Äúnutrients‚Äù tab, so I‚Äôm guessing nutrients only counts for macronutrients 

3) Unintuitive - you can check-in with your supplement in the ‚Äúmy plan‚Äù screen, at which point both my supplement and medication appeared. I checked both off, but then when I went to the ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù screen they weren‚Äôt there. So I added them to the check-in screen, but then I figured out you also have to click ‚Äúpost‚Äù before they are submitted. Meanwhile, I was checking with the ‚Äúreports‚Äù panel to try to figure the app out, which reported nothing, but took a second to load each time. 

4) Weird features aren‚Äôt included to try to bait you into contributing. 
This aspect is probably the most obnoxious, because I don‚Äôt understand what the app is capable of and what it isn‚Äôt. They have weird caveats - like requiring you to rate the app before you can see your medication track record (which I don‚Äôt care about), and having to pay an expensive subscription before you can see time stamps for your medications and stuff. (Which I imagine is a prerequisite to the correlations tab). 

It makes the whole app seem shady - especially because you have to have an account to try it out. 

I appreciate the concept of the app and I think I that the original design, and maybe 80% of the implementation was good‚Ä¶but it almost seems like they ran out of money at some point. Or they sold it out to someone who doesn‚Äôt care. 

Above all, what bothers me about the app is the lack of micronutrient tracking. Tracking micronutrients is essential for various disorders and diseases. Tracking amino acids would also go far in drawing correlations between symptoms for things like depression and ADHD. 

I don‚Äôt think this app is genuinely helpful in the way it was intended to be. It seems to offer little more than the generic weight tracking/diet tracking app, and potentially a little less in terms of actually tracking/graphing your progress appropriately‚Ä¶not to mention the bugs and loading time. 

Recommendations for improvement: 
- Let users test your app‚Äôs functionality fully, without a subscription, and let them register and pay a subscription for advanced insights, exporting data for doctors, social networking, and a more robust web interface platform with additional features. If you let people use the app properly, they will get over the initial barriers and learn to love it, then they will be loyal. Otherwise you chase customers away. 
- Include the ability to track and monitor fasts 
- Most importantly, include tracking micronutrients (especially from supplements)
- Include amino acid profile for subscribers on the online web interface (which can piggyback off of MyFoodPyramid‚Äôs data, possibly) 
- Include sections that can be hidden for entering negative consumption information like alcohol or drug use with privacy protection 
- Include a news portion on the browser side that offers recent medical news relevant to the drugs people are taking, or their negative habits 
- Cross-check supplements and substance intake with prescription medications to alert users of potential problems, provided they get a full account with a subscription and sign a waiver.

7624422438,"Tracker, Reminder - CareClinic",App Store,3,"Amazing concept, glitchy execution","Im using this for symptom tracking; chronic illness. As far as the concept goes, this is almost exactly what I was looking for in a healthcare app. I‚Äôd like to monitor numerous symptoms over time so I can be more prepared heading into doctors appointments. The other features are a perk.

I‚Äôve only been using a day or two and have a handful critical complaints. 1) no easy way to input historic data 2) app is extremely glitchy - reloads when you‚Äôre in the check in page, editing check ins doesn‚Äôt seem to work well - log time and medication/symptom time gets hard to change; app duplicates medications 3) extremely slow to load and change pages (likely syncing, but unsure why that should take so long). 4) would like to be able to reorganize symptoms (I have a very long list and newest additions go to the top). Maybe I can do that on the website or something - I haven‚Äôt checked to see if there is platform functionality / integration outside of the app. 5) haven‚Äôt noticed health integration adds much‚Ä¶ my sleep (from another tracker) will import for the wrong night, mucking everything up. Seems to correct later in the day (could be reporting lag from my fitness tracker app to apple health); it‚Äôs also not pulling in blood pressure, temperature, weight or heart rate data from apple health (via my other app). 6) reviewing Meds/symptoms in the log page leaves something to be desired when in tracking a lot. Ideally there would be a way to minimize some aspects of a daily log. But, this is a minor concern for now. 7) hate that hitting ‚Äúdone‚Äù on keyboard, after adding symptom note, brings you to the too of them symptoms page (in check in) - it‚Äôs already hard to scroll down without that. Small like that add a lot of user time for comprehensive tracking.

I‚Äôd like to use this long term, but my experience over two days has been frustrating. If I continue having these issues I‚Äôll likely track with pen and paper and move everything to excel. Such a pain, but also a pain to try apps - spend a ton of time to get everything set up and then dislike the experience‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt tried exporting to a doctor - would need more data - but will be interested to see that output.

Do not trust your healthcare in this app!! 

I didn‚Äôt get important reminders I was relying on and when I tried to check in it just wanted me to give a positive review then crashed.

Basically you‚Äôre going to be paying for something that doesn‚Äôt work... I‚Äôm curious to see if I will even get the $59 I paid for the full version just a couple of days ago... I‚Äôll update this review and let you know. (That would be something positive to write about, customer care!)

Navigating healthcare is already difficult enough and takes a lot of effort & advocacy.

Having this app should have made it easier, but it didn‚Äôt.

The potential for analysis is incredible yet the app is lacking in such a tool. It also weirdly adds my numbers in the day so if I say my joint pain was a 6 in the am and 3 in the pm - it shows my whole day as a 9?!

Lastly, it‚Äôs so frustrating that you have to upgrade to edit a post.

7084967260,"Tracker, Reminder - CareClinic",App Store,1,a robust medication & health tracker,"I have been on the hunt for a dedicated and robust medication & health tracker for several years now; and I thought that I had finally found it. Although, I really do prefer that any apps and programs that I consider allow for complete access as the user, meaning that any & all data that I enter is accessible by me. By using iCloud for my primary data storage and syncing, it allows me to have access and comfort knowing that I can download the information and files if I need to for any reason. This app here does not use iCloud for either purpose nor can you save PDF copies of the user‚Äôs information; so I cannot save a complete export of my medications, conditions, test results, etc. I have tried many of the health and medication trackers found on the Apple App Store due to several chronic medical conditions that I have; including severe pain (low back, shoulders, etc due to overwhelming arthritis issues) and anemia, along with some of the others that catch-up with you because of age (I‚Äôm looking at you high-blood pressure, prostate problems, etc). This app offers an incredible amount of detail and the fact that so many conditions that can be tracked, including ones that are typically not discussed such as prostate problems. The native Apple Health app has an entire section dedicated to Female issues, but not a single condition that affects Men. Not happy with that, as I pay retail for my devices, no discounts of any kind‚Ä¶ yet my health issues are disregarded by Apple with no ability to add them even in a general notes section of the Health App. I am going to follow up with Apple corporate regarding this limitation, as everyone deserves the right to not be disrespected & ignored in regards to their overall healthcare, etc. Anyway, this health tracking app is in some ways incredible with the amount of data that it is capable of handling + it is quite customizable as well. The primary reason that I was not able to leave anything I other than 2 Stars is because the app crashes frequently; including 5 times yesterday when I was trying to set things up and when I tried to enter some data today‚Ä¶ it crashed about 15 seconds into adding some pain issues. Luckily, today I had only entered 15 seconds of information but yesterday I had typed-out screens full of info to lose it when the crashes would occur. I cannot recommend an app that crashes this frequently as that is simply unacceptable, sometimes you do not have the ability to re-enter things due to timing or access to such data. Unfortunately, I have given up with regards to this app; as I just tried to start it up again and yet another crash after 5-10 seconds. I know that apps crash, just like crap happens; but maybe this company needs better coding staff. I have also noticed that coding at Apple in general, is also experiencing a little sloppiness in some of the details when it comes to spelling and cohesion within their operating system, etc. I do wish them luck in the development of their apps, but I cannot spend the time to be a Beta Tester as I do have full-time employment and medical problems that eat up most of my day and the few minutes of ‚Äúfree time‚Äù is for other things.

UPDATE:
I just got a notice from the app to log my symptoms and now the app is stuck after pressing necessary tab; I had to force-quit the app to get it working again.  These problems are occurring on both a new iPad and my iPhone, all with current updates, etc.  I am deleting the apps and moving on with life.  I guess it‚Äôs back to just using Apple Notes and some spreadsheets to log everything as these apps are just either too buggy (apps crashing) and/or have far too many limitations with the logging & tracking for someone that actually has medical issues.
