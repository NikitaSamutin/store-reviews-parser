For the past year, this app has been my companion and savior in managing medication for my mom, who loves elsewhere. She was getting confused about all the meds and when to take them and this was recommended to me by a person with ADHD as it helped them. Since day 1 it literally changed everything for her and she's been focused and able to handle it. We're connected as medfriends, so I can remind her if she forgets",Dave Bishop,25.01.2025,us,9.44.4,0
