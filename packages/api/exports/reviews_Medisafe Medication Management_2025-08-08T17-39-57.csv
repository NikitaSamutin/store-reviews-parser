I used to love this when I first started using it many years ago. Over time it started having lot of issues around reminders so I stopped using it. Now, I decided to give it a try again after 2-3 years and nothing works. I tried adding new medications and there was no input box to type the name of the medication. I tried adding reminder and was not able to do it. Basically the whole app has gone from excellent to piece of trash over last 7-8 years. May be they should just remove this from App Store.",Buddy914,03.08.2025,us,9.48.2,0

12935547537,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,3,OK but needs site chart,"This app is fine for listing medications and reminders to take, but is lacking a way to track where medications are injected, which would helpful because two different medications require subcutaneous injections, and the injection site is supposed to vary but it’s hard sometimes to remember where the last shots were taken",SFDMcI,25.07.2025,us,9.48.0,0

I need to track my blood glucose levels and now new meds and a variety of doctors appointments and tracking my Vitals. The reminders to take pills and customizable notes are quite literally a life save. I can track my doctors and appointments as well as send reports of sugar levels and other Vitals along with pill adherence. This app also tracks my med levels and sends reminders at a customizable time point to refill them. Best of all, the things I've needed it for are all free.

12910822816,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,1,Awesome except…,"When I use this app on my android phone, I never had one single problem with it. Ever since I started using it on my iPad, every time I have to confirm that I have taken/declined a med, I have to confirm twice. So when I tap on it to say “taken” or “not taken”, it never, and I mean, never, put a little checkmark or a little X next to the medication, it just refreshes without any annotation at all, as if I did nothing. Then I have to do it again in order for it to register. Otherwise this app is incredible! I have used it for years. I don’t really want to put one star but I’m sure that’s the only way to get the attention of the developers. I will change it when someone contacts me. Thank you.",PrncsLeiah,19.07.2025,us,9.48.0,0

Nearly ready to drop this if I can ‘t turn off the junk. It started as a wonderful app to provide medication reminders on a schedule. But then they thought it would be better if they added some other stuff. The problem is, as a responsible medicator, I already have those other aspects covered, taken care of and don’t require redundancy. But it’s right there. Didn’t ask me if I wanted it and don’t provide any way to turn it off. So suddenly, every morning, I am faced with bunches of trash all over my screen. I am ready to kick it out… actually, I did. I dumped it from my phone in a moment of “machine will NOT take over” The iPad  is on the verge of being booted. I’m sure I’m on a list of “don’t listen to him” because ALL  I really want is a list of my meds, with notices at the times I have to take them!

But when I attempted to keep track of my “as needed” Tylenol doses? Whoo boy. All sorts of fun ensued. It kept reminding me to take a dose and apparently the only way to stop it was deleting Tylenol from my list of medications and then re entering it again to my list.

No thanks.

If you’re elderly, not familiar with smartphone usage, or are thinking of setting this app up for someone like that: DO NOT DO IT. You could really mess yourself or a loved one up.",dunelizard,19.06.2025,us,9.47.2,0
12770634999,Medisafe Medication Management,App Store,1,"Such a bad user experience, it's potentially DANGEROUS.","What an awful user experience. When setting up the meds, it turns out that 3x a day is NOT the same as ""every 8 hours""—even though this is how hospitals do it. So it crams 3 doses into less time than intended, which is potentially dangerous. 

Next, the pill reminder is borderline unusable. There are 3 different views of your medications and schedule, and they each contain different information. The primary view doesn't even show my next dosing time. Why?

And if you take a dose late or early, it DOESN'T take that into account in your next dose (!!!!). So users, especially those who may have cognitive decline, can easily double up on dangerous meds like painkillers. 

This app is DANGEROUS, unusable, and embarrassingly bad. No clue how it has top ratings. Use Apple Health or write it down manually; don't risk your health.",nyc_77,13.06.2025,us,9.47.2,0

As an alternate, I’m loving the medication reminders in the iOS Health app. They’re exactly what I need — reminders and nothing else.

I love this app and have been using it for years now. It is a simple and effective medication reminder app, with persistent notifications which I really need.  However, the developers are trying to add some health topics and information to the app. I keep getting these annoying pops asking which health topics I’m interested in. I am not at all interested in health topics from this app. I need this app to be a medicine reminder app, nothing more, nothing less. It was perfect as it was.
