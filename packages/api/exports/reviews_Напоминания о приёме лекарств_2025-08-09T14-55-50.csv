The notifications have not failed even once so far and the tone is unique so I immediately recognize it when I hear it and I almost never miss my medicine anymore. I also love that it tracks how many doses I have remaining. I never even come close to running out anymore. 

BUT: the one and only suggestion I have is specifically for interval medications. If I‚Äôm late on my medication, the interval should reflect that! For example, my medication is taken once weekly. If I take my dose on Wednesday, then accidentally don‚Äôt take my next dose until Tuesday (13 days later rather than 7), I should not be reminded the very next day to take it again. It should remind me 7 days later.

Anyway, aside from that issue, this is a great app and I highly recommend it to anyone who takes medications and/or vitamins, even if you don‚Äôt have trouble remembering to take them!",stabbycatt,13.04.2025,us,3.213.0,0

The monitor feature tracks a wide range of treatments or task and graphs the trends so progress is easily understood. So far I track blood sugar, blood pressure, blood oxygen, mood, pains, weight and temperature. I have met with several doctors and they all congratulate me on what a fine job I am doing keeping track of my moms health. I have been using the app for about 5 months and it has helped me so much.

It reminds me when to take my medication daily  and different times of the day. It will give you the option to confirm that you took your meds or skip that particular medication and even give you a 30 min snooze. It gives you a mood section just to ask how you are feeling. Last but not least you are given a choice to get a report sent to you of your meds you‚Äôve tacked and moods. This is just a briefing of this wonderful app.

11853535675,Meds & Pill Reminder MyTherapy,App Store,5,Adhd and busy life: very helpful!,"I always have had difficulty remembering to take medicine consistently, or remembering if I took it. Now, my doc and I are on a journey trying to figure out which new medicine is going to be a good fit for a new issue. Each different medicine we try has different requirements- morning or night, certain time span before or after other meds, etc. I‚Äôm already taking other meds with requirements. This plus a busy lifestyle with many other responsibilities = a brain that can‚Äôt always keep up. I‚Äôve tried taking notes on a note app, but it‚Äôs clunky to look through a list and try to keep track of everything. This app is perfect for my needs. Simple interface = quick and easy to use. I love that I get a reminder to take meds at the right time, but I get to log it at the time I actually took it. This makes it so much easier to space out the rest of my meds appropriately according to what I actually did. It also helps me remember what I did in the days before, so if I‚Äôm consistently off for a while I can slowly make it back to my normal schedule. Thank you to the developers for a great app! Would love if you make one just like it for me to use to keep track of my kids‚Äô meds! When they all get sick, it‚Äôs a full time job to keep track of who can take what medicine, what dose, and what time. I love the clean, uncluttered interface of this medication log.",Willies06,20.10.2024,us,3.190.0,0

I take 30 meds a day and this reminds me to wake each one of them.  Also, it keeps track of how many of each pill I have left and lets me know when my supply is getting low, has a knowledgeable, professional, and efficient support staff for the app, reminds me of upcoming medical appointments, lists my support team (medical professionals), and has many more functions.  For an active 79-year-old, this app is very important because I would definitely cruise through the day forgetting to take my meds without MyTherapy‚Äôs reminders.
