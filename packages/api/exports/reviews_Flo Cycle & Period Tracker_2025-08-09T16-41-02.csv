Versions make the free version still useful and usable. Sure I wish I had the income to pay for the extra bells and whistles on the app, but for now the ability to log and track my cycle has been more than enough. Until

Up like this where it will do nothing but squat on my brain for weeks that maybe I have PCOS and should check it out I think is kind of short sighted when this is such an insidious disease that so few women understand and a lot of good could be done by making this screen part of the free app. Many lives could be made better and no you won‚Äôt make money of of these lives but they may owe the app a debt of gratitude and thus purchase a subscription.

I tried out their free trial and it stated they would only charge 2 days before the trial ended which was a 7 day trial. The next day they was charging my card and the charges were 4 times more than the subscription I chose as a trial. So I immediately cancelled the trial the very next day. Well 2 months later they started charging my card the amount that was 4 times more than the subscription I chise. I had contacted them 3 times to take my info out and 3 more times they tried charging my card with tgat amount that I dont even know where they even got from. I literally had to get a lawyer to file for unauthorized charges because on my receipt for my trial there is nothing on there stating they was going to be taking the amount they was charging my card for. After lying about charging my card the very nxt day after i started the trial when it clearly says they wont charge until 2 days before the end of the trial which was 5 days later, immediately showed they were dishonest from the get go, but to start making charges 4 times more than the trial I was trying out, 2 months after i cancelled the trial, is more than strange and to have to contact them repeatedly to stop making unauthorized charges is just insane!! I thought this was going to be an awesome app but it turned out ti be nothing but dishonest crooks. If u try out their trial u better immediately cancel if u decide u dont want it and then start contacting them to take out ur info or they will randomly steal from you months later and wont stop! Check them out on the better business bureau website bcuz they have many complaints about this issue! So if you decide u dont want their service, they will just keep charging you anyways until u get a new card or press charges. Most dishonest business of crooks I ever came across.

Each time I get pregnant (this has happened twice, in 2022 and again in 2025), the app automatically deletes my most recent period logs without notifying me. This is frustrating because while the app correctly calculates how far along I am, it makes it look like my last period was actually the one before the most recent one. As a result, when I share my last period date with a healthcare provider, it doesn‚Äôt match up with the app‚Äôs calculation and my real gestational age, which can cause confusion.

This seems like a significant oversight, especially for users who rely on the app‚Äôs accuracy in medical settings.

When you‚Äôre trying to tell your doctor your last period, the last thing you want to do is wait for a graphic telling you how long you‚Äôve been using the app-and get this- offering you a discount for the premium version! Another feature of the app is providing information about the female body, which is great. But what‚Äôs NOT so great is inappropriate notifications at work or school. I just wish I could turn off those notifications specifically. Another thing, that might just be me nit picking is that it always OVERpredicts my period length. If my period is consistently 3 days (for FOUR years see complaint about that) why does it always predict it as 5 days, and record it as such too! If i don‚Äôt log the end of my period, it will cite that i bled for that whole time!",lovelivireviews,22.07.2025,us,9.83.0,0

1. section for if you took a plan b where you log your symptoms
2. option to put down vomiting in the digestion and stool section
3. stop misleading users with premium ads

there‚Äôs so many options on the ‚Äúlog your symptoms‚Äù section including if you took a pregnancy test, if it was negative or positive, it even asks about birth control and if you tested for ovulation. youd think there would be a plan B option, right? but there isnt. plan b seriously messes with your hormones and can affect your period and i really think that should be on there so flo can educate users and give more reasons why your period may be late/early. or even check up on some symptoms to make sure everything is okay. next, is theres a digestion and stool section where you log your symptoms. it‚Äôs got diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and even bloating. but no vomiting? it would only make sense to have that as an option

lastly, i want to address flo shoving premium down your throat. it‚Äôs ridiculous and didn‚Äôt used to be that way. sometimes i cant even open the app because it‚Äôs advertising getting premium and there wont even be an X button. you have to clear the app and open it again for it to disappear. and here‚Äôs where it‚Äôs really bad: flo will tell you a certain symptom you logged is concerning and asks if it can ask a few questions or if it can check your symptoms for SERIOUS MEDICAL CONDITIONS. you answer a bunch of questions thinking you are going to get help and it‚Äôs very thorough until it makes you pay/get premium to see the results. absolutely disgusting 

i would give it 1 star, but it gets 2 because i begrudgingly still use it in hopes for improvement",üå∏ùîπùïùùï†ùï§ùï§ùï†ùïûüå∏,07.07.2025,us,9.82.2,0

It gives me a sense of control and confidence around my period, my health, and even my mood.

What‚Äôs even more empowering is that it‚Äôs helping my husband understand what I might be feeling or needing on a given day. We‚Äôre more connected, more communicative, and feel in sync‚Äîespecially when it comes to our sex life. This app has truly brought more awareness and ease into our relationship.

We know we want a family one day, but until we‚Äôre ready, we love that Flo helps us confidently manage our sex life and avoid pregnancy naturally and intentionally.

I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to feel more in tune with their body and more empowered in their partnership. ü´∂",Peytzoriginal,07.07.2025,us,9.82.2,0

Not only was there no value, there was no score and to cancel (because you had to commit to a monthly reup) the process was not the standard Apple process. I would give it 0 starts if I could.
