11189782732,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,4,"Really good, 1 main issue tho","Overall I really like this app so far. I‚Äôve tried habit tracking apps for meds/ other things but got limited by # of habits for the free version. 

I have had no such issues yet and I‚Äôve included quite a few things already. I also love that it‚Äôs free. Health should not be behind a pay wall. 

 I've just started setting things up and so far it's feeling pretty good, but I do have some user interface/ user experience suggestions that I think would be helpful. 

 Let‚Äôs start with the pros 

 I really enjoyed how the first ""condition/symptoms"" page was set up. It showed typical clusters of symptoms related with the selected conditions. This page also had a little info icon next to the symptoms so you could determine if it applied to you or not.

 I also like that you can add other symptoms that are unrelated to any ‚Äúcondition‚Äù per se. For example I get migraines kinda randomly, it‚Äôs nice to be able to track that, even if it‚Äôs not related to a medical condition I know I have.

 I like that you can add ‚Äúsuspected conditions‚Äù self-diagnosis is valid imho and can lead to an actual diagnosis-even if it wasn‚Äôt what was initially thought, it leads to overall better health interventions. 

 I also like the mini ‚Äúbreathing break‚Äùit‚Äôs a nice touch for mental health 

 Here‚Äôs the things that could use some work 

 The downside (and my main gripe) is that after I set up a few initial conditions, i moved on from the tutorial and adding conditions/symptoms got harder. Most of the rest of this is suggestions on how that can be improved. 

 I had the idea I could go back and add the rest after finishing the ‚Äútutorial‚Äù since I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time while initially exploring the app. And The way my brain works is that filling in some symptoms reminds me I have other things going on (surprise surprise, I know). So I had stopped adding conditions and was looking at my home page then I tried to double back when I remembered other things.

  While I can go back and add known/ suspected conditions, I found that it no longer showed clusters of symptoms associated with it and it also didn't show the little info icon for further info to see if it applied to me. I‚Äôm not sure if that is by design, but it makes it harder when I‚Äôm trying to go back and add when I already ‚Äúplayed ‚Äú the tutorial. 

 I just wish I could double back to the setup page or be able to ‚Äúreplay‚Äù the tutorial because that was easier to navigate .

 I don't know all of symptoms I could/should be looking for with my suspected conditions. Heck I don‚Äôt even know all of the symptoms for my known conditions (some from ADHD surprised me since I‚Äôm not impatient/ share well with others ). 

 So my suggestions are 

1) Make adding a known/suspected condition bring up a list and the info on symptoms like in the initial set up screen. That was amazing. I‚Äôve tried more than once already to click on a symptom for more info and added it instead.

2) The symptoms are listed for the most part as proper medical terms/ diagnostic verbiage so that info button was really helpful, please add it back 

3) Make it easier to find the individual‚Äôs medical info. It‚Äôs not very intuitive to have it under you name, then click settings, then click medical info, then click conditions. With my ADHD by then it‚Äôs hard to remember what conditions I was thinking of. 

4) I suggest that your profile icon leads directly to your profile settings, like many other apps and that way your medical info button is right there already, if not already opening the known/suspected conditions tab. No extra clicks to get lost in. Either that or have a +condition next to the +symptom button for quick adds. And as stated above have the quick add condition bring up those symptom clusters",DzBelle,23.04.2024,us,3.0.10,0

But unfortunately, I am stuck at the beginning, due to the app (honestly, sort of hilariously) seemingly capping my symptoms at 99. 
I have a lot going on, and unfortunately picking-and-choosing the most important symptoms to track is not my forte. I genuinely hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as hostile, I just think this is really funny in a weird way - and I‚Äôd love to know if it‚Äôs Bug or Feature.",PleaseNoProfileSave,11.03.2024,us,2.0.22,0
10921598824,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,5,CPTSD help app,I struggle with so much and this helps me keep everything in line. It would be amazing to be able to monitor my brain activity to detect cptsd triggers and intigrate that. But that‚Äôs a very out there idea.,Demondragonwren,10.02.2024,us,2.0.14,0
10465474324,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,4,Helpful,"I downloaded this app to help me keep track of ADHD symptoms and how my treatment plan was mitigating them. I really like the insights interface and flexibility with adding symptoms. Where this app falls short is in its user-friendliness. You‚Äôre not able to edit your daily check-ins, so you can‚Äôt make a mistake. This is set up in a really inflexible way. 

 UPDATE: the developers reached out to me after I posted this review to share some of the upcoming changes being made to the app and continued to check in with me on my feedback of the new changes. The new changes add much needed flexibility and user friendliness. I appreciate the development team for being so invested in their user base and being open to feedback!!",CeebieBeenie,12.10.2023,us,1.2.28,0
10288724334,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,5,Above and beyond,"I recently downloaded this app to help track my bipolar symptoms, however I was unable to fully use the app due to technical issues involving my older phone model. After being contacted by their technical team, they were kind enough to adjust the app so that I am now able to use it without any issues. Astounding customer service, and such an exciting concept for an app. I am very pleased.",Skitshens,23.08.2023,us,1.2.26,0
10205145272,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,5,Helps me see clearly!,"Honestly I‚Äôve been looking for a way to help with my PTSD instead of just avoiding it. Human helps me collect my thoughts into one place and allows me to track the treatments I need as well. Sometimes it isn‚Äôt enough to just get up and get going all by myself. Sometimes it‚Äôs just hard to get out of bed and just want to be alone. Being able to see what going on in front of me helps me think more clearly so I can stay on track and this app isn‚Äôt the answer to all my problems, but it is a step in the right direction.",senicaja,01.08.2023,us,1.2.24,0
10059046943,Human Health: Chronic Illness,App Store,5,What I have been waiting for!!,This app is exactly what I have dreamed of for many years! I like to keep track of new meds and supplements but it‚Äôs so hard to tell what is actually helping my symptoms over time. This is the real deal! Excited to see my progress over time!,jwSueBlue,22.06.2023,us,1.2.20,0
